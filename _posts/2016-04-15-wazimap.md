We're excited to share that you can now install [Wazimap as a Django project using pip](http://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). This makes it much simpler to re-use Wazimap and build out a Wazimap website for your country or city. This will help many more people use Wazimap to *find the story behind the data*.

## Don't leave home without it

Since early 2014, [Wazimap.co.za](http://wazimap.co.za) has been used by thousands of people across South Africa to understand where they live, go to school and do business. It has become a critical tool for activists, journalists, political parties and many more who need to make informed decisions about their lives and work.

We regularly hear how exploring a place in Wazimap--such as [the stark Richtersveld](http://wazimap.co.za/profiles/municipality-NC061-richtersveld/) in the remote north-west of South Africa--makes statistics and numbers approachable, friendly and understandable. So we're excited to make it easier for more countries and cities to make their data simpler to use.

Building out a new Wazimap for a country has been time consuming and complex. It's now much simpler with the new [pip-installable Wazimap](http://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Developers can focus on the data they want to open up rather than worrying about the technical details of the website. 

Read up on [how to build your own Wazimap](http://wazimap.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and check out the [Wazimap source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap). Follow [@Wazimap on Twitter](https://twitter.com/@Wazimap) and let us know how it goes!

## A global team

Making Wazimap possible has truly been a world-wide team effort. Building a pip-installable Wazimap has been a collaboration between Code for South Africa and [David Lemayian](https://twitter.com/davidlemayian) and his team at [Code for Africa](http://www.codeforafrica.org/).

Wazimap is built on the amazing [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org/), which was created in the USA as a Knight News Challenge project and was built by [Joe Germuska, John Keefe, Ryan Pitts, Ian Dees and Sara Schnadt](http://censusreporter.tumblr.com/people). In early 2014, Code for South Africa and [Media Monitoring Africa](http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/) collaborated to customise Census Reporter for South Africa and Wazimap was born.
