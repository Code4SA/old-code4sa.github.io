The open data movement in South Africa is on a roll and we need you to join us on October 24 for game-changing events in Durban, Pretoria and Cape Town.

The triple events are aimed at liberating SA's data and we need you to join us in making history by showcasing just what could be done with open data. 

We’ve been hard at work at Code for South Africa liberating official government data and so far we’ve collected 300 datasets … and counting.

At the events journalists, designers, developers, analysts and others engaged in the world of data 
will work in teams to produce stories with social relevance, with at least one high-impact data visualisation, using one or more of the datasets that we’ve hunted down.
The stories will be judged based on whether the piece is relevant to the man on the street and how well the data visualisation works and supports the story. 

If you need more convincing, there will be a bunch of prizes up for grabs for the best stories plus lunch and refreshments throughout the day.

See [Durban](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-Durban-Meetup/events/226075253/) and [Cape Town's](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-South-Africa-Hackers/events/226054849/) Meetup events as well as the [Durban](https://www.facebook.com/events/1622911277970025/) and [Cape Town](https://www.facebook.com/events/873820766029291/) Facebook event.
