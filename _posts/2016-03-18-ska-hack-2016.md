Last weekend, Code for South Africa helped facilitate the [#SKAHack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SKAHack) that took place at the Mayibuye Centre in Galeshewe, Kimberley.

Even though, as the name of the event indicates, a focus on the SKA was intended, the theme was opened to any topic on the day, so as not to tie the attendees down with the complexities of dealing with the data that was available.

The event took place over two days, which was kicked off with an overview of the data pipeline by Code4SA.

The participants showed a great deal of enthusiasm, with most working throughout the night in coming up with solutions to improve the situations of the communities they live in. To me, this sense of community and the taking of responsibility was the highlight of the weekend.

Ideas worked on included an application to notify government on water leaks, a couple serving as career guidance for young adults interested in STEM fields, and another to monitor crops using aerial footage.

Well done to [Geekulcha](http://geekulcha.com/) for arranging a successful event, and a thank you to the [Department of Economic Development and Tourism](http://economic.ncape.gov.za/) of the Northern Cape in supporting the event.

We look forward to being involved in more Northern Cape activities in the future.
